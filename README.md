# scrollable-xyz-list

I want to build a scrollable list of available 1-word .xyz domains.

I have a list of registered XYZ domains I would like to upload. 1 domain per line. 

that list should be checked against the dictionary word list found here: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words.txt which should be cloned + included locally for easier searching against the uploaded txt list

Any words found on the dictionary word list, but not present in the registered XYZ name txt file uploaded should be displayed in a list with infinite scrolling
